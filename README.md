**⚙️ How the Project Works**

1.  Backend (Flask) → Manages customers, dues, payments, emails, and logs 📂 (stored in CSV).
    It also runs background schedulers to send daily reminders ⏰ automatically.
    All business logic and activity tracking is centralized here.

2.  Frontend (Streamlit) → Admins manage records & analytics 📊; customers view/pay dues 💳.
    It connects to the backend APIs 🔄 and shows real-time data in an interactive dashboard.
    Provides a clean, user-friendly interface for both roles.

3.  Emails → Auto-sent for account creation, reminders, and receipts ✉️.
    This ensures both admins and customers are always updated on activities.
    Notifications improve communication 📢 and reduce missed payments ❌💰.
